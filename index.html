          <h1>Edmonton</h1>
          <p>Edmonton is the capital of Alberta , and is located on the North Saskatchewan River, near the geographical centre of the
             province. Commonly known as the "Gateway to the North," it is strategically situated on an economic divide between the
             highly-productive farmlands of central Alberta and a vast, resource-rich northern hinterland.</p>
